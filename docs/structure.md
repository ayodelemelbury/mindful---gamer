     **I.**     	**📑 Assignment Structure and Marking Breakdown:**

     
1\. 	**Introduction \[Marks –15%\]:** In this section, you will introduce the project and briefly describe the User-Centred approach. Additionally, indicate the business requirements, the methods and tools used for prototype development, justify the decision-making process, and demonstrate the integration of references to support your choices.  
   
2\. 	**Literature Study \[Marks –15%\]: In** this section, you need to conduct a critical review of related systems, applications, or devices. Highlight key theories, frameworks, and case studies, identifying design gaps your work addresses. The study must demonstrate a strong academic foundation, integrating recent research and contemporary industrial practices.  
   
3\. 	**Requirement gathering \[Marks –15%\]:** In this section, you will describe how you generated and developed your requirements and will formally describe the requirements for your project. This should include information about the participants that you think is relevant, e.g., numbers involved, age, gender, background, etc., and a description of how you obtained the requirements, including the methods used and your reasons for selecting these methods (using references to support your decisions). Where relevant, this section should present the results of any applicable requirements-gathering activities concisely and informally; for example, any tables or graphs, observations, quotes, or other data (if included) should be easy to read and understand   
4\. 	**Prototype Design \[Marks – 25%\]:**    
a) 	In this section, you will explain how you translate the user requirements into the design of the prototype solution. You need to show a diagram based on your project flow.  
**\[Marks – 5%\]**  
**b)**	You should include screenshots or sketches of the interaction design for the prototype you created to show essential design elements or features You can use a software tool to create your illustrations and other techniques; hand-drawn designs are unacceptable. You will explain the rationale for the selected design solutions, connecting both your requirements to gathering and design. Principles drawn from the literature/references where necessary to support your choices) to your prototype solutions **\[Marks – 20%\]**  
   
   
5\. 	**Poster Presentation of your project \[Marks –10%\]:** In this section, you will design and include a professional poster within your report (Insert as a figure) to showcase your project. The poster should communicate key findings through engaging visuals, succinct text, and effective data visualization. It should aim to capture attention, encourage discussion, and summaries of your work. It aims to engage the audience with engaging visuals, succinct content, and data visualization. You need to insert this as a Figure in your report  
   
   
   
6\. 	**Reflections \[Marks –10%\]:** You must summaries the solution, lessons learnt, limitations and reflections. References and citations must be provided. The arrangement of the table of contents, text, headings, subheadings, and visuals on the page should be appealing and easy to follow. Consistency in formatting font, terminologies, and style throughout your Assignment. Figure numbers and references to the figure numbers are essential  
7\. 	**Video Demonstration \[Marks –10%\]:** In this section, produce short (3-5 mins), well-structured video demonstrating your prototype using nay software. The video should present the application’s flow, highlight key interactions, and briefly reflect on the rationale behind design choices.  
   
   **II.**     	**Deliverable- Multiple file submissions – (3 files):**   
1\. 	**File 1: Assessment report:** Your word report should include supportive screenshots (should be formatted into figures) along with well- justified explanations for the screenshots provided.
